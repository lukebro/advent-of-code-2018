## Goal

I'm not concerned with runtime efficiency or Big O complexity when solving these problems. Really I'm just trying to get a working solution and that's about it. My goal is to just try and finish the thing this year 🤞.

Allowing myself to use `lodash` as a utility. As of now haven't had a need for it, perhaps later. I'm open to use other open sourced libraries as utilities as long as they don't complete the puzzle for me.
